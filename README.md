# ðŸŽ¨ Project Delta: Glitch Art Generator

*"Breaking things beautifully since... well, about 3-4 days ago"*

## ðŸŒŸ What Is This?

Ever looked at a perfectly good image and thought, "You know what this needs? More digital chaos"? Well, you're in luck! **Project Delta** is a glitch art generator that takes your pristine photos and turns them into beautiful digital disasters.

Think of it as a digital vandalism tool, but the kind that gets you featured in art galleries instead of arrested.

## ðŸš€ Features That Actually Work

- **5 Unique Glitch Effects** (that's more than most relationships have!)
  - **Pixel Sort**: Organizes your pixels like a very confused librarian
  - **Channel Shift**: Makes your RGB channels socially distance from each other
  - **Random Noise**: Adds digital dandruff to your images
  - **Data Corruption**: Simulates what happens when your computer has a mild existential crisis
  - **Scanline Effect**: Gives your photos that authentic 80s TV vibe

- **Universal Intensity Slider**: Because one size does NOT fit all chaos
- **Real-time Preview**: Watch your images descend into beautiful madness
- **Simple GUI**: So easy, even your grandma could accidentally create cyberpunk art
- **100% Free**: Like free pizza, but for your creative soul

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
