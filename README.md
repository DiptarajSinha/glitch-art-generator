# 🎨 Project Delta: Glitch Art Generator

*"Breaking things beautifully since... well, about 3-4 days ago"*

## 🌟 What Is This?

Ever looked at a perfectly good image and thought, "You know what this needs? More digital chaos"? Well, you're in luck! **Project Delta** is a glitch art generator that takes your pristine photos and turns them into beautiful digital disasters.

Think of it as a digital vandalism tool, but the kind that gets you featured in art galleries instead of arrested.

## 🚀 Features That Actually Work

- **5 Unique Glitch Effects** (that's more than most relationships have!)
  - **Pixel Sort**: Organizes your pixels like a very confused librarian
  - **Channel Shift**: Makes your RGB channels socially distance from each other
  - **Random Noise**: Adds digital dandruff to your images
  - **Data Corruption**: Simulates what happens when your computer has a mild existential crisis
  - **Scanline Effect**: Gives your photos that authentic 80s TV vibe

- **Universal Intensity Slider**: Because one size does NOT fit all chaos
- **Real-time Preview**: Watch your images descend into beautiful madness
- **Simple GUI**: So easy, even your grandma could accidentally create cyberpunk art
- **100% Free**: Like free pizza, but for your creative soul

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** (If you don't have this, we need to talk)
- **A computer** (surprisingly important)
- **An internet connection** (for downloading dependencies, not for the app itself)
- **A sense of humor** (optional, but recommended)

### Quick Setup
Clone this digital playground
```
git clone https://github.com/DiptarajSinha/glitch-art-generator.git
cd glitch-art-generator
```

Install the magic ingredients
`pip install Pillow numpy`

Launch the chaos machine
`python gui.py`

**Note**: `tkinter` comes free with Python, like the toy in a cereal box, but actually useful.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Launch the app**: Run `python gui.py` and watch a window appear (magic!)
2. **Load an image**: Click "Load Image" and choose your victim... I mean, your artistic subject
3. **Adjust intensity**: Move the slider to control how much digital destruction you want
4. **Apply effects**: Click any effect button and watch the beautiful carnage unfold
5. **Save your masterpiece**: Click "Save Image" and share your creation with the world
6. **Reset and repeat**: Because one glitch is never enough

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- **Start with low intensity** (0.1-0.3) unless you enjoy pure chaos
- **Combine multiple effects** for that "my computer is definitely broken" aesthetic
- **Use high-contrast images** for more dramatic results
- **Don't glitch your only copy** of important photos (learned this the hard way)
- **Portrait photos** work surprisingly well with channel shift effects

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Random Noise** might be too subtle on some images (we're working on making it more aggressively random)
- **Data Corruption** sometimes creates art that's too beautiful (not really a bug, more like a happy accident)
- **Users may become addicted** to glitching perfectly good photos
- **May cause sudden urge** to start a digital art Instagram account

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- **Stack Overflow**: For answering questions I was too embarrassed to ask
- **Coffee**: For being the real MVP during the 3-4 day development sprint
- **My Computer**: For not giving up despite processing thousands of corrupted pixels
- **Happy Accidents**: For teaching us that sometimes the best art comes from things going wrong

## 🎭 Fun Facts

- Developed in **3-4 days** (because who has time for proper planning?)
- **Total cost: $0.00** (cheaper than therapy, more colorful than sadness)
- **Lines of code**: Enough to be dangerous, not enough to be professional
- **Coffee consumed**: Yes
- **Sleep lost**: Also yes

## 📞 Support

Having issues? Here's our comprehensive support system:

1. **Read the error message** (revolutionary concept, I know)
2. **Try turning it off and on again** (works 60% of the time, every time)
3. **Check if your image file exists** (computers are picky like that)
4. **Sacrifice a USB cable to the coding gods** (surprisingly effective)
5. **Open an issue on GitHub** (actually helpful option)
